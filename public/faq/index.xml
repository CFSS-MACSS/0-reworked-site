&lt;p>This course is open to any graduate (or advanced undergraduate) at the
University of Chicago. We draw from a wide range of departments such as
Information Science, Sociology, Psychology, Political Science, etc.
Typically these students are looking to learn basic computational and
analytic skills they can apply to master’s projects or dissertation
research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you have never programmed before or don’t know what the
&lt;a href="https://cfssmacss.netlify.app/setup/shell/">shell&lt;/a> is, &lt;strong>prepare for a different way of approaching
problems&lt;/strong>. This class will prove to be very beneficial if you stick
with it, but that will require you to commit for the full quarter. I do
not presume any prior programming experience, so everyone starts from
the same knowledge level. I guarantee that the first few weeks and
assignments will be rough - but the good news is that they will be rough
for everyone! Your classmates are struggling with you and you can lean
on one another to get through the worst part of the learning curve.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Homework Rubric</title><link>https://cfssmacss.netlify.app/faq/homework-evaluations/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cfssmacss.netlify.app/faq/homework-evaluations/</guid><description>&lt;h2 id="evaluation-philosophy">Evaluation philosophy&lt;/h2>
&lt;p>The university requires that I assign each student a letter grade at the end of the quarter. However I find that numeric scores on assignments tend to cause students grading anxiety if they do not achieve a perfect 100%. Nor does the numeric score convey specific feedback as to what the student has done well on an assignment, combined with feedback on areas for improvement.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As such, I do not assign numeric scores in this class. All homework assignments are evaluated using the grading rubric below. Final grades are calculated as the cumulative performance across all homework assignments.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>How to ask for help</title><link>https://cfssmacss.netlify.app/faq/asking-questions/</link><pubDate>Sun, 25 Sep 2022 00:00:00 -0500</pubDate><guid>https://cfssmacss.netlify.app/faq/asking-questions/</guid><description>&lt;p>Asking questions is an important part of this class. Remember the &lt;strong>15
minute rule&lt;/strong>: Once you’ve spent 15 minutes attempting to troubleshoot a
problem, ask for help.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Questions should be posted to &lt;a href="https://edstem.org/us/courses/79778/discussion">Ed
Discussion&lt;/a> in the
appropriate category (general v discussion). Here are some &lt;strong>tips&lt;/strong> you
should always follow when posting questions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="introduce-the-problem-with-an-informative-title">Introduce the problem with an informative title&lt;/h2>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Bad title: “I need help!”&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Good title: “Getting a ‘file not found error’ when importing
scotus.csv”&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Be specific with your title. It should be brief, but also informative so
that when others are looking at it (and they have a similar error and/or
solution), they can easily find it.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
