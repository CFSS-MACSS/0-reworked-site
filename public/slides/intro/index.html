# Succeeding in the class

---

## General Expectations/Suggestions


* Attend classes

* Bring a laptop

* Complete the readings before coming to class

* Please no abuse of emails, texts, social media, etc. during lectures 

* Collaborate and ask for help

* Start early to work on the homework assignments 


---

## Asking for help


### 15-minute rule

When stuck, you HAVE to try on your own for 15 min. After 15 min, you HAVE to ask for help


### Resources

* [Google](https://www.google.com)

* [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/)

* Me and TAs

* Fellow students (e.g. study groups)

* [Class discussion page on Ed Discussion](https://edstem.org/us/courses/40496/discussion/)

## Plagiarism

### Collaboration is good - *to a point*

* Collaboration is good: researchers usually collaborate with one another on projects. Developers work in teams to write programs. Learning from others and/or the internet is fine (e.g., to debug something, to get unstuck on a specific part of your code, etc.)


* BUT you are expected to complete your own work, understand what the code is doing and be prepared to explain it in details to someone else.


* In your homework, at the top: please mention the resources you had access to complete the homework (e.g., I met with the Prof. Clipperton for the part of code ... I asked advice to my colleague name for... )


---

## Homework and Evaluation


* **Regular programming assignments**: eight in total.

* **Late Work Policy**: you can submit up to two assignments up to 24 hours late without penalty; no questions asked. After 24 hours, we do not accept late work. 

* **Extraordinary circumstances** (illness, family emergency, etc.): I may grant additional extensions on a case-by-case basis. Whenever possible, inform me before the deadline. Please, note that having a heavy workload in a given week does not qualify as an extraordinary circumstance. The purpose of the two extensions is precisely to give you some flexibility in weeks when you are busier than usual.

Stata is for the most part a GUI software. 

A GUI software runs using all the basic programming elements, but the end user is not aware of any of this. Instructions in GUI software are implicit to the user, whereas programming requires the user to make instructions explicit.

**What are the advantages of learning to program VS. using a GUI software, such as Stata?**

---

## Two different approaches

**TASK**: Write a report analyzing the relationship between ice cream consumption and crime rates in New York City.

**APPROACH**: Read how Jane and Sally approach this task [in our website](https://macs30500.netlify.app/notes/intro-to-course/#benefits-to-programming-vs-gui-software) (5 min readings start from "Benefits to programming vs. GUI software")

## Automation


* Jane forgets how she transformed and analyzed the data
    * Extension of analysis will fall flat
    
    
* Sally uses *automation*
    * Re-run programs
    * No mistakes
    * Much easier to implement *in the long run*

---

## Reproducibility

* Are my results valid? Can it be *replicated*?
* The idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them
* Also allows the researcher to precisely replicate his/her analysis

---

## Version control

* Revisions in research
* Tracking revisions
* Multiple copies
    * `analysis-1.r`
    * `analysis-2.r`
    * `analysis-3.r`
* Cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, Box) vs. Version Control Software
    * Repository on your computer for which the VCS tracks all changes (who, when, what, etc.). Example: Git
    * Usually implemented in conjunction with remote serves to store backups of your repository. Example: GitHub

---

## Documentation

* *Comments* are the what
* *Code* is the how
* Computer code should also be *self-documenting*
* Future-proofing

---

## Badly documented code
