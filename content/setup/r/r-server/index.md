Let’s begin with a few definitions:

## R

[R](https://www.r-project.org/) is an open-source programming language
based on the [S](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/S_(programming_language))
from the 1970s. It is very popular in the physical and social sciences
due to it’s cost (free) and versatility. Thousands of expansion
libraries have been published which extend the tasks R can perform, and
users can write their own custom functions and/or libraries to perform
specific operations.

## RStudio

The base R distribution is not the best for developing and writing
programs. Instead, we want an integrated development environment (IDE)
which will allow us to write and execute code, debug programs, and
automate certain tasks. In this course we will use
[RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/RStudio/), perhaps the most
popular IDE available for R. Like R, it is open-source, expandable, and
provides many useful tools and enhancements over the base R environment.

## RStudio Workbench

Rather than installing your own copy of R and RStudio, you can access R
and RStudio remotely hosted on a server. Specifically, the [Social
Sciences Computing Services](https://sscs.uchicago.edu/) hosts RStudio
Workbench for us. Rather than running an application on your computer,
you open RStudio in your web browser. All the processing and computation
is done on a remote server. This means virtually all of the software is
pre-configured for you. Setup is minimal.

The downside is that you only have access to this server for the
duration of the class. If you intend to use R and RStudio in future
classes/research projects, you will need to install and configure
everything on your own computer after the course is completed.

## Accessing RStudio Workbench

1.  Go to <https://macss-r.uchicago.edu/> to login to the server. Save
    the link somewhere since you will be using it frequently
2.  Use your
    [CNetID](https://uchicago.service-now.com/it?id=kb_article&kb=KB06000393)
    and password to login (this is the same username/password you use
    for other UChicago online services).
3.  You’re done. You should see a fresh RStudio window in your browser.

Only students in this course who have been approved by SSCS can access
this server. If you cannot log on to the server, email me or the Server
Team at <ssc-server-support@lists.uchicago.edu> to let them know that
you are enrolled in the class (MACS 30500) and you have problems
accessing the server.

If you have problems with cVPN or the network, contact
[ITS](https://its.uchicago.edu/)

## Test it

You should see something that looks like this:

{{&lt; figure src=“rstudio-server.png” caption=“” &gt;}}

The RStudio IDE is divided into 4 separate panes (one of which is hidden
for now) which all serve specific functions. To make sure R and RStudio
are setup correctly, type `x <- 5 + 2` into the *console* pane (the one
on the left side of your screen) and execute it by pressing
Enter/Return. You just created an object in R called `x`. Type
`print(x)` into the console and press enter again. Your console should
now contain the following output:

    x <- 5 + 2
    print(x)
