## Overview

- Define HTML and CSS selectors
- Introduce the `rvest` package
- Demonstrate how to extract information from HTML pages
- Practice scraping data

## Before class

- Chapter 1 and 4 in [Web Scraping with
  R](https://steviep42.github.io/webscraping/book/)

Several packages are needed for this week’s lectures (all installed on R
workbench). If you are using R from your laptop (VS. R Workbench), I’d
suggest following the lectures using R Workbench and installing the
packages after class.
