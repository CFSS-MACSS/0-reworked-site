## Overview

- Define shapefiles and import spatial data using the `sf` package
- Draw maps using `ggplot2` and `geom_sf()`
- Change coordinate systems
- Generate appropriate color palettes to visualize additional dimensions
  of data

## Before class

- Read [Importing shapefiles using `sf`](/notes/simple-features/)
- Read [Drawing vector maps with `ggplot2` and
  `sf`](/notes/vector-maps/)

## Class materials

- [Selecting optimal color palettes](/notes/optimal-color-palettes/)

- [Practice drawing vector maps](/notes/vector-maps-practice/)

- [Mapping data in *The Truthful Art* by Alberto
  Cairo](https://newcatalog.library.cornell.edu/catalog/15104586) -
  excellent chapter on designing data maps with lots of examples. Though
  really the entire book is useful if you do a lot of work with data
  visualizations of any type.

## What you need to do after class

- [Complete the geospatial visualization
  homework](/homework/geospatial-viz/)
