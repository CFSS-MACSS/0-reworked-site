        <h1 id="overview">Overview</h1>
<p><strong>Due by 11:59 pm on July 16th.</strong></p>
<p>The goal of this assignment is to practice the fundamentals of text
analysis in R tidyverse.</p>
<h1 id="accessing-the-hw08-repository">Accessing the <code>hw08</code> repository</h1>
<ul>
<li>Go <a href="https://classroom.github.com/a/eey4atfa">to this link</a> to accept
and create your private <code>hw08</code> repository on GitHub. Your repository
will be built in a few seconds. It follows the naming convention
<code>hw08-&lt;USERNAME&gt;</code></li>
<li>Once your repository has been created, click on the link you see,
which will take you to your repository.</li>
<li>Finally, clone the repository to your computer (or R workbench)
following the process below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice the repo you clone for this assignment is empty: <strong>add your data
and code, and push them to your GitHub repo</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="cloning-your-hw08-repository">Cloning your <code>hw08</code> repository</h1>
<p>After you have accessed the <code>hw8</code> repository (see above), follow the
<a href="/homework/edit-readme/">same steps you completed for <code>hw1</code></a> to clone
the repository.</p>
<h1 id="general-workflow">General workflow</h1>
<p>Your general workflow will be as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accept the repo and clone it (see above)</li>
<li>Make changes locally to the files in RStudio</li>
<li>Save your changes</li>
<li>Stage-Commit-Push: stage and commit your changes to your local Git
repo; then push them online to GitHub. You can complete these steps
using the Git GUI integrated into RStudio. DO not directly modify your
online GitHub repo (if you do so, remember to pull first); instead,
modify your local Git repo, then stage-commit-push your changes up to
your online GitHub repo.</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="assignment-description">Assignment description</h1>
<p><strong>Goal:</strong> practice the fundamentals of text analysis in R (import and
pre-process data, perform exploratory analyses, and perform sentiment
analysis OR topic modeling).</p>
<p><strong>Instructions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Select a corpus and import it.</strong> See below for suggestions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Clean and pre-process your corpus.</strong> Apply the following as
necessary for your project (e.g., you do not have to apply all of
them): tokenize the text, convert it to lower case, remove or replace
unwanted tokens, remove stop words (standard and/or domain-specific),
apply stemming or lemmatization. Use regular expressions as necessary.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Perform basic exploratory analyses.</strong> This can include a count and
plot of standard word frequencies, tf-idf, and/or other topics covered
in class or the assigned readings (e.g., use the tidy text approach).
To complete these tasks: see <strong>“Text Mining with R” Chapters 1, 3, 4
and lectures</strong>. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Explain the analyses you perform and what constitutes your unit of
analysis (e.g., what makes a document in your corpus). Briefly
explain the techniques you use</li>
<li>Produce at least two visualizations, or one visualization and one
descriptive table</li>
<li>Interpret the results</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Perform sentiment analysis OR topic modeling</strong>. To complete this
part: see <strong>“Text Mining with R” Chapters 2 and 6 and lectures</strong>.
Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Include an explanation of the method you choose, including its pros
and cons. This does not have to be an in-depth theoretical or
mathematical explanation, think about it as an overview of the
method that you would provide to someone that knows nothing about
it; use your own words, but make sure to refer to the assigned
readings (for instance Blei et al. article for topic modeling) and,
if you use additional references, cite them as well</li>
<li>Explain step-by-step what you do (for example, for topic modeling:
data preparation, document-term-matrix, criteria used to select the
number of topics, etc.)</li>
<li>Produce at least one visualization</li>
<li>Interpret the results</li>
<li>Suggestions:
<ul>
<li>if you use topic modeling and your data are formatted as tidy text
(one-term-per-row data frame), you first have to convert them into
a matrix, specifically a document-term-matrix. “Text Mining with
R” Chapter 5 explains how to do so</li>
<li>if your corpus is big, feel free to select only a subset of
documents for this assignment; the bigger the data, the more
difficult it is to analyze it and make sense of</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Examples to follow:</strong> * Book <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/index.html">Text Mining with
R</a>, especially the assigned
Chapters; among the case studies, I recommend Chapter 9 but the other
case studies also provide excellent insights * In-class materials</p>
<p><strong>How much do you need to do?</strong></p>
<p>Your main tasks are: import and pre-process the data, analyze them for
general exploratory analysis, and then apply sentiment analysis OR topic
modeling (do not do both, just pick one).</p>
<p>I expect you to use the class materials and the book <a href="http://tidytextmining.com/">Tidy Text Mining
with R</a> as templates to perform this type of
analysis (do not reinvent the wheel). You can apply the templates to a
novel corpus. You are also welcome to use one of the provided examples
as your data source, as long as you expand on the provided code (e.g.,
if the readings perform sentiment analysis on a specific textual corpus,
you can use the same corpus to perform topic modeling instead).</p>
<p>In all circumstances, <em>make sure to quote your resources</em> (assigned
readings and additional online tutorials or resources you might rely
on).</p>
<h1 id="suggested-data-sources">Suggested data sources</h1>
<p>You can use <strong>any source of textual data.</strong> If you are not sure, here
are some suggested texts you could use:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>gutenbergr</code> (see also Chapter 1 of the assigned readings on this)</li>
<li><a href="https://data.stanford.edu/congress_text">Congressional Record for the 43rd-114th Congresses: Parsed Speeches
and Phrase Counts</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.figure-eight.com/data-for-everyone/">Data for Everyone</a> -
a bunch of open-source data sets. Some contain text data, such as <em>New
England Patriots Deflategate sentiment</em></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/t-davidson/hate-speech-and-offensive-language">Hate speech
samples</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.kaggle.com/mykhe1097/last-words-of-death-row-inmates">Last statements by Texas death row
inmates</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.cs.cornell.edu/people/pabo/movie-review-data/">Movie Review
Data</a> - good
for sentiment analysis</li>
<li><a href="http://millionsongdataset.com/musixmatch/">The musiXmatch Dataset</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/sou.php">State of the Union speeches</a>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/statsmaths/sotu"><code>sotu</code></a> - R package with all
State of the Union speeches through 2016. Easier starting point.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1I7cvuCBQxosQK2evTcdL3qtglaEPc0WFEs6rZMx-xiE/edit#gid=0">Something from
here</a>
(by Chris Bail)</li>
<li>Examples provided in the readings and lectures. The <a href="https://github.com/dgrtwo/tidy-text-mining">data from the
book are stored in this GitHub
repository</a></li>
</ul>
<h1 id="submit-the-assignment">Submit the assignment</h1>
<p>Your GitHub repo should include everything you have used to produce your
analyses, such as R scripts and/or R Markdown documents, original
textual data (unless they are too large to be uploaded on GitHub – see
HW6 for details), etc. Make sure to stage-commit-push your original
<code>.Rmd</code> file and its <code>.md</code></p>
<p>In your <code>README.md</code>: * explain the purpose of the repository * include
an explanation of what your code does and how to use it, and list all
libraries required to reproduce your analyses * include a description
of the textual data * provide any other relevant information that the
user needs to know in order to use your repo and replicate your results
* quote all resources you consulted to complete the assignment *
provide 1-2 paragraphs of reflections on what was hard/easy about this
homework, what was enjoyable, problems you solved and how you solved
them, helpful resources, etc. + list any collaborators and their role</p>
<p>To submit the assignment, push to your repository the last version of
your assignment before the deadline. Then copy your repository URL
(e.g., <code>https://github.com/cfss-hmwks-s23/hw08-jmclip</code>) and submit it to
Canvas under HW08 before the deadline.</p>
<h1 id="rubric">Rubric</h1>
<p>Needs improvement: Not all elements listed in the instructions are
addressed. Code does not run and/or has bugs. Code is short/elementary
and poorly documented. No clear effort is made to pre-process the text
for analysis, or no justification is provided for keeping content such
as numbers, stopwords, etc. Results are poorly interpreted or
misinterpreted. Visualizations do not include any element more than the
basics. There is little attention to reproducibility issues and little
consistency in the code’s style.</p>
<p>Satisfactory: Solid effort. Hits all the elements. Finished all
components of the assignment with only minor deficiencies. Easy to
follow (both the code and the output).</p>
<p>Excellent: Displays in-depth understanding of course materials,
including data analysis and coding skills. Code to process and analyze
the data is complex/refined. Visualizations are excellent. Explanation
of the chosen technique is accurate with an assessment of the
appropriate caveats for what the technique can and cannot do.
Interpretation of the results is clear and in-depth and shows engagement
with the content of the textual data. Code is reproducible. Uses a
sentiment analysis or topic model example not directly covered in class
or considerably expands on the provided examples.</p>
