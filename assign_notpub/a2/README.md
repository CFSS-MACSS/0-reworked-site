# About this assignment

Task:

* Edit this to provide details about your assignment directory

## Required packages
You should have the following packages installed (already installed on R Workbench):

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(stevedata)
data(gss_wages)
```

## Assignment submission
Follow the instructions on our website under A2 to submit your homework and check which files should be submitted.

For your benefit, this repo includes a starter R Markdown document (.Rmd). Do not rename this document and do not delete what is already in there, merely add on to it and add your name in the YAML header as indicated in the document.

The demo folder includes a minimal example solution (.md). This file does not contain the code necessary to complete the homework, but does show you output from R for potential solutions. Your solutions do not need to perfectly replicate these potential solutions, especially for the last open-ended question, but they are a good starting point.
