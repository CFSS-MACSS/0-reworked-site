## Assignment 2
We have a framework below -- complete it to finish this assignment. 

### Load packages

```{r loading}
library(tidyverse)
library(stevedata)
library(knitr)
library(psych)
data(gss_wages)
```

## Explore the data
We are using a sample of GSS data. To learn more, [see this dataset description here](https://r-packages.io/datasets/gss_wages).

### Very specific questions
1. Load and describe the dataframe 'gss_wages'


1. Generate a data frame that summarizes the number of women and men per education category Print the data frame as a formatted `kable()` table.

1. Generate a boxplot visualizing the wages of individuals, by recoded occupational category.




1. Generate a bar chart that identifies the total number of children by each education category. The bars should be sorted from highest to lowest.


### More open-ended questions

Answer the following questions. Generate appropriate figures/tables to support your conclusions.

1. How many women and how many men have a high school education? 





1. How does the distribution of wages vary across the different (recoded) occupations? Reorder your chart from above to sort from lowest to highest median. 


### Very open-ended questions

Answer the following questions. Generate appropriate figures/tables to support your conclusions. Provide 1-2 paragraphs of written interpretation of your results for each question. Graphs and/or tables alone will not be sufficient to answer these questions. You will be graded on your code and your analysis. 

1. We generated total number of children by category. Is this helpful to understand the question of whether people with different educational backgrounds have more children? Explain why or why not, and include any supplemental visualizations you wish. 
1. Consider the findings regarding income and occupation. What additional variable might you use to help you uncover any additional underlying trends? Be specific and provide additional visualizations and/or tables as needed. 


### AI / Resources statement. 
All assignments need about one paragraph describing the resources you used (including links and prompts, as relevant) in completing the assignment. This helps us learn about your process. Include this in your assignment submission.
